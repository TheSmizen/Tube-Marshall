# Tube-Marshall

Travelling Salesman - here we go.
Trying to -uh- marshall ourselves around the tube network. All sorts of stuff is going to go into this.
Using some combination of the Google Maps and TFL APIs, create a program to map out a best-case tube challenge.

## TODO:
### Research:
- [ ] Test out API calls to https://api.tfl.gov.uk/
- [ ] Test out API calls to https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/
- [ ] Research simple programming frameworks and which to use to create a quick mock-up app. First thoughts are Typescript desktop app + electron + react.

### Organise:
- [ ] Plan out what actual functions the program will need to do for us
- [ ] Plan out what the output of the program will look like - is it explicit instructions or is a semi-assisted route finder I.E. will it give the user different route branches and options?
- [ ] Are there any visual aspects or is this more or less text-based?

### Code:
- [ ] ???
